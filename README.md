# STTApi
TypeScript Client API for Star Trek Timelines. Modified from the IAmPicard API.  All endpoints of the tool which initiated a game action (e.g. starting a voyage or playing the gauntlet) have been removed.  These aspect of the app will not return in this repo.  Do not ask me to add them.  It won't happen.

This repository is not really useful by itself. It's designed to be used as a submodule in the [Star Trek Timelines spreadsheet tool](https://github.com/iamtosk/StarTrekTimelinesSpreadsheet)
